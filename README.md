# SpeedoBLE-iOS
iOS app that connects to Watchy speedo app via bluetooth

## Speed Alarms
Click on the clock icon to configure speed alarms.
You can add a list of speed values that will trigger a 1 second vibration on the Watchy when that speed has passed.
It has to be 2 consecutive passes to make sure we filter out any GPS anomalies that might cause a speed spike.
This is useful to know if you've passed a certain speed without having to look at the Watchy screen.
